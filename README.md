# Experiment with Equivariant Neural Networks


Group equivariant convolutional neural networks
(G-CNNs) has been introduced by Cohen &
Welling (2016). These new models can be considered as an evolution of convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). The key operation which G-CNNs use is G-Convolution; this is a new layer
that make neural networks equivariant to new
symmetries. In this paper, I’ll provide a theoretical overview of G-CNNs, G-Convolution and
finally I’ll show the performance of G-CNNs
vs CNNs on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets.

Read the paper for more details.
In the Notebook you can have access to the code. All dependencies are intstalled in the notebook. Therefore the notebook is ready to run.

For more details about the implementation, you can look the original repository [GrouPy](https://github.com/tscohen/GrouPy)

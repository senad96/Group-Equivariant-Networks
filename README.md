# Group-Equivariant-NeuralNetworks-testing


Group equivariant convolutional neural networks
(G-CNNs) has been introduced by Cohen &
Welling (2016). These new models can be con-
sidered as an evolution of convolutional nerual
networks (CNNs). The key operation which G-
CNNs use is G-Convolution; this is a new layer
that make neural networks equivariant to new
symmetries. In this paper, I’ll provide a theo-
retical overview of G-CNNs, G-Convolution and
finally I’ll show the performance of G-CNNs
vs CNNs on Fashion-MNIST and CIFAR-10
datasets.
